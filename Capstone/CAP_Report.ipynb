    "This is a theremin-like instrument which operates using two distance sensors, two speakers, one button, and an LED. Distance sensors take readings which indicate whether the instrument should be making sound, and which notes it should play. The button is used to make recordings, indicated by the LED when recording is in progress. Recordings can be stored and accessed again through the user interface, which is also used to turn the Theremin on and off."
