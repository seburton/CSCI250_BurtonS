Distance sensors take readings which indicate whether the instrument should be making sound, and which notes it should play. The button is used to make recordings, indicated by the LED when recording is in progress. The recording is then saved to be used for playback or to look at with a graph."

    "2. Read the pulse as it returns and record stop time.\n",

If the file name is not changed, it will increase the last number in the name by one so the previous file won't be overwritten. You can also change the file name by pressing the 'Rename' button in the same tab.\n",
