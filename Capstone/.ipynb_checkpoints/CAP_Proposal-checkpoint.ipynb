    "**Description:** We will build a theremin-like instrument using two distance sensors, one speaker, one button, and an LED. The instrument makes sound through the speaker. The distance sensors will be used to control the notes the instrument plays and whether it is making sound (constant or vibrato). The button will be used to start recording (an LED signals recording).\n",
    "- Distance sensors: Distance sensors will be on opposite sides of the breadboard so the signals do not interfere. On one, the note played by the instrument will be different depending how far away the user's hand is. As distance increases the note becomes lower. The type of sound made (constant, vibrato, or no sound) is determined by the other sensor. When the hand is far away, no sound is made. When it is closer constant sound is made, and when it is closest there is vibrato."
